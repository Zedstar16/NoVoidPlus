Does what it says in the name, saves a player from the void.
The below is all customisable in the config.yml
# You can change:
-The message sent to the player when they fall into the void
-Whether the player is teleported to the default spawnpoint of the world they are currently in or if they should be teleported to set XYZ coordinates, change the spawn-level to wherever you want the player to go when they fall into the void if the teleport to default world spawn is disabled.

# TODO:
-Add a feature to run commands from console and from the player when they fall into the void
